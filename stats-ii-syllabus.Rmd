# Course Description

This course will introduce students to the estimation of linear regression models, diagnostics, and the presentation and interpretation of results.
The course will require a significant time commitment from most students and will move at a rapid pace, covering a good deal of material beginning with an introduction to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for multiple regression and ending with an overview of some more advanced statistical tools used in political science research.
In addition to the class meetings, students are expected to keep up with the readings, complete roughly biweekly problem sets, and attend weekly discussion sections that will focus on reviewing material and introducing students to the computing tools used in the course, particularly the R statistical computing environment.

# Required Readings

We will work from the text *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* (7th edition, 2020) by Jeffrey Woolridge.
(An earlier edition should be just fine).
Any other readings will be available electronically.

# Course Requirements and Evaluation

Course grades are comprised of the following components:

- 30%: Midterm Exam
- 30%: Final Project
- 40%: Problem sets

## Problem sets

There will be six problem sets assigned over the course of the semester.
You will have roughly a week and a half to complete each one, though you are *strongly* encouraged to begin work early as the problem sets will take several hours of work to complete.
Students are allowed, and honestly encouraged, to work together on the problem sets, but each student must write up and turn in solutions in their own words.
I recommend using R Markdown or LaTeX to typeset your problem set solutions, but I do not care what software you use as long as it produces a PDF where any math that's included is legible.

## Midterm Exam

The exam, covering regression and diagnostics, will be made available on Canvas at 12:01 a.m. the day of the exam and must be turned in by 11:59 p.m. the day of the exam.
So, you can take more or less as much time as you need within that day, you can take breaks if you need to, you can start/complete it as early or as late as you like, as long as it's turned in by 11:59 p.m.
As with problem sets, I do not care what software you use to produce your PDF of answers as long as I can read it.
**Unlike problem sets, collaboration with other students is forbidden**, though you are free to use your notes and your textbook.

## Final Project

Instead of a final exam, students will complete a final project consisting of a presentation and a paper utilizing the tools you will learn this semester.
The final paper will include two components: (1) the replication of a published paper in political science in which you obtain the data from the author or journal and attempt to reproduce their results; and (2) the extension of the existing work into an original research paper that includes a well-defined research question, theory, hypotheses, results, and robustness checks.
Possible avenues for extension include revamping the analysis, testing an alternative hypothesis, or adding new data.

The final presentations will be in the style of conference presentations in that you will have about 10 minutes to present your work and one of your classmates will be assigned as your discussant to provide feedback on your research.
You will need to provide your discussant with an outline or draft of your paper at least a week before the presentation (including all results).
Discussants will need to read the paper and prepare 2-3 minutes of comments.
Other students are also expected to contribute to discussion.

# Course Policies

This syllabus is subject to change as necessary, but if a change is necessary, you will be notified both in class and via email about the change and access to an up-to-date copy will be provided.

### Classroom safety and COVID-19

- For any illness, students should stay home if they are sick or contagious, not only to stop the spread, but also to promote their personal wellness.
- The university will continue to provide rapid antigen self-test kits at distribution sites throughout campus. Students can receive up to four tests at a time.
- The university will provide symptomatic COVID-19 testing on campus for all students, faculty and staff.
- UHS maintains up-to-date resources on COVID, which can be found here:

  + COVID-19 Exposure Action Chart

### Carrying of Handguns on Campus

Texas' Open Carry law expressly prohibits a licensed to carry (LTC) holder from carrying a handgun openly on the campus of an institution of higher education such as UT Austin.
Students in this class should be aware of the following university policies:

- Students in this class who hold a license to carry are asked to review the university policy regarding campus carry.
- Individuals who hold a license to carry are eligible to carry a concealed handgun on campus, including in most outdoor areas, buildings and spaces that are accessible to the public, and in classrooms.
- It is the responsibility of concealed-carry license holders to carry their handguns on or about their person at all times while on campus. Open carry is NOT permitted, meaning that a license holder may not carry a partially or wholly visible handgun on campus premises or on any university driveway, street, sidewalk or walkway, parking lot, parking garage, or other parking area.
- Per my right, I prohibit carrying of handguns in my personal office. Note that this information will also be conveyed to all students verbally during the first week of class. This written notice is intended to reinforce the verbal notification, and is not a "legally effective" means of notification in its own right.  

### Title IX Disclosure

Beginning January 1, 2020, Texas Education Code, Section 51.252 (formerly known as Senate Bill 212) requires all employees of Texas universities, including faculty, to report any information to theTitle IX Office regarding sexual harassment, sexual assault, dating violence and stalking that is disclosed to them.
Texas law requires that all employees who witness or receive any information of this type (including, but not limited to, writing assignments, class discussions, or one-on-one conversations, or third party reports) must be report it.
Before talking with me, or with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, please remember that I will be required to report this information to the Title IX Coordinator.
If you would like to speak with someone who can provide support or remedies without making an official report to the university, please email <supportandresources@austin.utexas.edu>.
For more information about reporting options and resources, visit <http://www.titleix.utexas.edu/>, contact the Title IX Office via email at <titleix@austin.utexas.edu>, or call 512-471-0419.

Although graduate teaching and research assistants are not subject to Texas Education Code, Section 51.252, they are still mandatory reporters under Federal Title IX laws and are required to report a wide range of behaviors we refer to as sexual misconduct, including the types of sexual misconduct covered under Texas Education Code, Section 51.252.
The Title IX office has developed supportive ways to respond to a survivor and compiled campus resources to support all impacted by a Title IX incident.

### Campus Safety

The following are recommendations regarding emergency evacuation from [the Office of Campus Safety and Security](https://safety.utexas.edu/), 512-471-5767, 

- Students should sign up for Campus Emergency Text Alerts at the page linked above.
- Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus must evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.
- Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
- Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
- In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
