# Course Description

This course will introduce students to the estimation of linear regression models, diagnostics, and the presentation and interpretation of results.
It will require a significant time commitment from most students and move at a rapid pace, covering a good deal of material beginning with an introduction to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) for multiple regression and ending with an overview of more advanced tools used in political science research.
In addition to class meetings, students are expected to keep up with the readings, complete roughly weekly problem sets, and attend weekly discussion sections focused on reviewing material and introducing students to the computing tools used in the course, particularly the R statistical computing environment.

# Required Readings

We will use *Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach* (7th edition, 2020) by Jeffrey Woolridge (an earlier edition should be fine).
Any other readings will be available electronically.

# Course Requirements and Evaluation

Course grades are comprised of the following components:

- 30%: Midterm Exam
- 30%: Final Project
- 40%: Problem sets

## Problem sets

There will be ten problem sets.
You will have one week to complete each.
You should early as they take several hours.
Students may collaborate on problem sets---I encourage it---but each must write up and turn in solutions in their own words.
I recommend Quarto, R Markdown, or LaTeX for typesetting,
but I only require that your solution PDF, including any math, is legible.

## Midterm Exam

The exam will cover regression & diagnostics.
It will be available on Canvas at 12:01 a.m. the day of the exam.
You must submit it by 11:59 p.m. the same day.
This is the only time constraint.
So you may take the entire day if you like, you can take breaks, start/complete it as early/late as you like... as long as it's submitted by 11:59 p.m.
As long as the solution PDF is legible, I do not care what typesetting software you use.
**Unlike problem sets, collaboration with other students is forbidden**, though you are free to use your notes and your textbook.

## Final Project

Instead of a final exam, students will complete a final project consisting of a presentation and a paper using the tools you'll learn this semester.
The final paper has two components: (1) replicating a published paper in political science (i.e. get the data from the author or journal and try to reproduce the results); and (2) extending the existing work into an original research paper including a well-defined research question, theory, hypotheses, results, and robustness checks.
An extension could include improved methods, alternative hypotheses, or new data.

The final presentation will be like an MPSA presentation:
You will have 8 minutes to present your work.
Another student will be your discussant & give feedback.
You must give them a draft of your paper at least one week before presentations.
Discussants must read the paper and prepare 2 minutes of comments.
Other students are also expected to contribute to discussion.

I strongly encourage you discuss your project with me within about one week of returning from spring break.
You will get comments at your presentation and have about a week to revise your paper afterward before it is due, but discussing the project beforehand will help you succeed.

**The final paper is due on May 1, 2025**

# University Policies

For a list of important university policies and helpful resources that you may need as you engage with and navigate your courses and the university, see the [University Policies and Resources Students Canvas](https://utexas.instructure.com/enroll/TP964H) page.
The page includes the information on, among other things,

- the University Honor Code
- how to receive support through the office of Disability & Access,
- resources for your physical and mental health,
- academic aid resources, and
- Title IX legal requirements for Texas employees.

Some of these are reproduced below for your convenience.

## Academic Integrity Expectations

Students who violate University rules on academic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course and/or dismissal from the University.
Since such dishonesty harms the individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on academic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.
For further information, please visit the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity website at: <http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct>.

Plagiarism is taken very seriously at UT and is subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course.
To learn more about what plagiarism is and how to avoid it, see the [Avoiding Plagiarism tutorial](https://guides.lib.utexas.edu/c.php?g=539686&p=8083280) developed by the UT Libraries in partnership with the Writing Flag program and Student Judicial Services. 

## Religious Holy Days

By [UT Austin policy](https://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/academic-policies-and-procedures/attendance/), you must notify me of your pending absence as far in advance as possible of the date of observance of a religious holy day.
If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, you will be given an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.

## Disability & Access

The university is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive learning environment consistent with university policy and federal and state law.
Please let me know if you experience any barriers to learning so I can work with you to ensure you have equal opportunity to participate fully in this course.
If you are a student with a disability, or think you may have a disability, and need accommodations please contact Disability & Access (D&A).
Please refer to the D&A website for more information: <http://diversity.utexas.edu/disability/>.
If you are already registered with D&A, please deliver your Accommodation Letter to me as early as possible in the semester so we can discuss your approved accommodations and needs in this course.

## Sharing of Course Materials is Prohibited

No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class without explicit, written permission of the instructor. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. The University is well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure of the course.
