# Wooldridge 12.2

Explain what is wrong with the following statement:
"The Cochrane-Orcutt and Prais-Winsten methods are both used to obtain valid standard errors for the OLS estimates when there is a serial correlation."

# Wooldridge 12.C8 (lightly modified)

Use the data in `wooldridge::traffic2` for this exercise.

a. Run an OLS regression of `prcfat` on a linear time trend, monthly dummy variables, and the variables `wkends`, `unem`, `spdlaw`, and `beltlaw.`
   Test the errors for AR(1) serial correlation using the regression in equation (12.20).
   Does it make sense to use the test that assumes strict exogeneity of the regressors?
b. Obtain serial correlationâ€“ and heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors for the coefficients on `spdlaw` and `beltlaw`, using four lags in the Newey-West estimator.
   (You can use the function `sandwich::NeweyWest`).
   How does this affect the statistical significance of the two policy variables?
c. Now, estimate the model using Prais-Winsten and compare the estimates with the OLS estimates.
   (You can use the function `prais::prais_winsten()`).
   Are there important changes in the policy variable coefficients or their statistical significance?
